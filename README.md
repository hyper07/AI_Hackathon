# AI Hackathon: Wound Image Classification with MongoDB Vector Search

> **Developed for the VOXEL51 & MongoDB AI Hackathon**

This project demonstrates an end-to-end AI application for medical image classification, leveraging **MongoDB's vector search** to identify wound types from images. The stack is containerized using Docker Compose and integrates **Flask**, **Jupyter**, and **MongoDB** for scalable, reproducible development and deployment.

## Project Overview

This application was created as part of the **VOXEL51 & MongoDB AI Hackathon**. It enables users to upload wound images and receive automated wound type predictions using a trained deep learning model. The system stores image embeddings in MongoDB and utilizes **vector search** to efficiently retrieve the most similar cases, supporting explainable AI in medical diagnostics.

**Key Features:**
- **Wound Image Classification:** Predicts wound types from uploaded images using a trained neural network.
- **MongoDB Vector Search:** Stores image embeddings and retrieves similar cases for explainable results.
- **Interactive Web UI:** Built with Flask for easy image upload, prediction, and result visualization.
- **Jupyter Integration:** For model training, experimentation, and data exploration.
- **Containerized Stack:** All services run in isolated Docker containers for easy setup and reproducibility.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: Stores image data and embeddings, provides vector search capabilities.
- **Flask**: Serves the web application and API endpoints.
- **Jupyter**: Supports interactive development and model training.
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates multi-container deployment.

## My Contributions

- Designed and implemented the end-to-end pipeline for wound image classification.
- Integrated MongoDB vector search for efficient and explainable image retrieval.
- Developed the Flask web interface for user interaction.
- Automated the environment setup using Docker Compose.
